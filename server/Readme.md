# Development Idea  

- There has to be one route where the blog content + blog author + time stamps could be posted .
```js
/blog :
    get().post().put().delete()
```
The above route has 4 CRUD actions . There expected description is as follows:  
1) get : this would give all the blog available in the database.
2) post : this would allow the user to post blog to the api
